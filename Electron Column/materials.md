# Materials

## Electron Gun
filamentholder.FCStd: Two-sided filament (AEI) holder, made of polycarbonate/PC, -9900V.
WehneltCylinder.FCStd: Wehnelt Cylinder, -10,000V, Al-6061.
Anode.FCStd: Al-6061, 0V.

Estimates: Diverging beam, 9.9kV.

Distances measured from the beam source.

## Electromagnetic Lenses

For the pole piece: one internal piece, one external piece, attached w/screws. 920, 920, 600 turns. 65, 65, 55 mm height, 78, 78, 84 mm OD, 26, 26, 46 ID. 3A current, 2.8A current, 1.1 A current. 14 AWG wire. Center of condenser lens at 80mm, Focal position 1 at approx. 100mm, Center of Condenser 2 at 164mm, Focal position 2 at approximately 170 mm, center of Objective at 295mm and focal position at 315 mm.

A 1000 micrometer aperture (custom-machined from [Molybdenum](https://www.amazon.in/Aviation-Metal-Alloys-Pure-Molybdenum/dp/B08RBPM7JK)) as the condenser aperture at 60 mm and a 200 micrometer aperture as the condenser aperture at 280 mm.

The housing will be M19, and the pole piece will be M5 (with the grain aligned with the flux). Shouldn't cost more than $100 for the full assembly. 

We also need ~500m of 14 AWG aluminium wire which is either insulated or enameled, for as cheap as possible, which is roughly 14.5 USD, and definitely under 100

Every exterior of the EM lens should be in 4 pieces, and the pole piece as 1. Design the CAD files of these next.

Two halves for the inside and two halves for the outside because not only do you need to assemble the two inside halves with the pole piece inside but you need to assemble the inside first so you can wind it and then assemble the outside.

## Lens Housing

Housing of these will be in Al-6061. Design this in CAD.
