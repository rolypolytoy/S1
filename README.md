# S1 Desktop SEM
A project working on building upon Applied Science's DIY SEM (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdjYVF4a6iU&t=467s) to produce a low-cost, reproducible, accurate Desktop SEM using formal engineering practices, computational physics, and a workflow with the rigor of scientific instrumentation without the cost.

## Design

The main four modules that are being designed are:

**Vacuum Integrity:** Finished. Diffusion Pump design and rotary vane pump are fully obtainable, with more complete instructions at https://github.com/rolypolytoy/diffusion_pump.

**Electron Column:** Finished. The actual design of an SEM column is completed at and with the help of Picht (https://github.com/rolypolytoy/picht/blob/main/examples/sem.py).

**Detection, Control and Embedded:** Underway.

**Frame, Stage and CAD:** Underway.

## Assembly
Upcoming.
