# Materials
## Electromagnetic Lenses

For the pole piece: one internal piece, one external piece, attached w/screws. 3A current, 2.8A current, 1.1 A current. 14 AWG wire. Center of condenser lens at 80mm, Focal position 1 at approx. 100mm, Center of Condenser 2 at 164mm, Focal position 2 at approximately 170 mm, center of Objective at 295mm and focal position at 315 mm.

A 500 micrometer aperture as the condenser aperture at 60 mm and a 200 micrometer aperture as the objective aperture at 280 mm.

We also need ~500m of 14 AWG aluminium wire which is either insulated or enameled, for as cheap as possible, which is roughly 14.5 USD, and definitely under 100

Every exterior of the EM lens should be in 4 pieces, and the pole piece as 1. Design the CAD files of these next. Scanning coils (solenoid), stigmators (octupole), and alignment coils (quadrupole) also necessary using 14AWG Al wire and M19 cores where relevant.

## Lens Housing

Housing of these will be in Al-6061. Design this in CAD. Assembly is the key word- you do have to assemble things together, that's all. Alignment is critical.

Main problems: solving for modularity. That's all it is. I.e. Assembly's & frame's all that's left.
